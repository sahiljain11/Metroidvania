## About

In this app, I used the sample app collision detection to create a starter code for game developers to utilize in the upcoming Metroidvania competition on itch.io. The code allows for sprite selection, placement, and interaction in a simple, coherent manner.

## DragonRuby

To create this game, I utilized the game engine DragonRuby. DragonRuby is an incredibly powerful game development engine that provides simplicity without taking away functionality. For more information, pleaes visit the following link:
